# Analyzing-Facial-Recognition-Algorithms

## This project has been implemented as a part of the course - Advanced Machine Learning (ECE 5424/CS 5824)

The aim of this project is to train and test the already implemented Facial Recognition Algorithms like the FaceNet aglorithm or even the readily available simple Facial-Recognition Algorithm with masked or unmasked images and test it over the masked images to check for their accuracy. Also, due to the lack of datasets with occluded images, a python script has also been developed to add occlusions to any image using the Python Dlib library.

This project is yet to be tested on real world images.

## Usage

All the implementations have been done on Google CoLabs and the Jupyter Notebooks of the same have been shared here. The notebooks have all the dependencies which are to be installed to run the code.

The notebooks given here can be directly imported to Google Colabs and can be runned from there in little time.

## Dataset

All the datasets that have been used to train and test the models can be found here.
